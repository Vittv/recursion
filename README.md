# The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript

# #8 Project: Recursion

This project was focused on making us practice recursive solutions for algorithms.

You can test and make use of it by cloning the repo and changing the `argument` in fibonacci or the `arr` in mergesort.

Node.js is required to run it and you will first need to install it. Once you have it installed you can simply run each script by getting into their folder from your terminal then entering `node mergesort.js` for example.
